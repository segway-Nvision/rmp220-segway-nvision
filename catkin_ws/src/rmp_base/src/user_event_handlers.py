"""
This is the class that defines how to handle events passed up by the RMP class.
These events currently include:
RMP_IS_DEAD: The main loop should recongize that the RMP thread is no longer alive
             and should try and respawn or kill the main loop

RMP_TX_RDY: The RMP class can accept a new command. Commands sent before this event
            will be queued and executed asyncronously. The user should only post new
            commands once this event has been triggered

RMP_RSP_DATA_RDY: A response packet is ready for the user.
